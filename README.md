# CampingProject

Our website will allow users to learn about, locate, and interact with an inventory of National Parks across the US. Similar to AllTrails, it is designed to help users find relevant campsites near them, add a campsite of interest (if not already included), and (if time allows) a volunteer form for camp cleanup.

As a user, I can search National Parks in my area using a Search bar and a filterable list.
I can view descriptions, activities, and images by interacting with cards for up to 500 parks.
I can fill out a form to add specific locations in National Parks to add commentary.
I can click to view a gallery of images from each park location.
